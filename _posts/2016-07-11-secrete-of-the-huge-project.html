<h2 id="orgheadline1">How to write something that really works in a most efficient way?</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline1">
<p>
As the project goes larger and larger, I can never get rid of the fear of the code will go out of my control. However, I need to face it. I can't being super clear at every time about how all the code is working, in fact, it is impossible for a person to just understand how a huge work is working at every step. Even if you write the whole project on your own. It may be possible for you to understand the code when you just finish that piece of the part of the code, nevertheless, after some time, you will always confused about your former codes. So how can I solve this problem? Is there a way suitable for me to control the whole big project?

<h2 id="orgheadline2">Possible cause for the problem</h2>

In order to solve this problem, we need to first find out what is the cause for this problem. Why is it so difficult for a person to remember all the work flow at any moment? I got an answer here, the short term memory for a person is limited. 
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
maximum number of figures we can remember in the short term memory is \(7\pm 2\).
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Hence, I guess, the maximum size of logic that can be handled by any human beings is also limited. So, It looks like an tragedy that we can never handle the huge project easily. Is that really the truth?

<h2 id="orgheadline3">Solution</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline3">

Though, the reality seems to be an disaster, there is always a way to solve it. For me, the secrete is built deep inside the most fundamental thoughts inside our brain, <b>Dynamic programming</b>, <b>recursion</b>, <b>black box model</b>, and <b>unit test</b>. Here we got the constraint on our mind, we can only focus on a small number of stuffs at one time. So, what if, we just admit it, and just do a small number of stuffs at one time? Which means that we should never think about more then a small number of logic flows. For example, all of the things we do every time is just always something that is super easy like plus and multiply, etc. However, if we only build such small stuffs, how can us ever build something has tens of thousands of lines of code to work? Secretes here is that, we need to learn to "believe". Every time we build a new function, we are always just assemble some small stuffs and made a little more action, And just <b>BELIEVE</b> that all the small part we use is perfect on there functions, they will always generate the input we need for our model.
