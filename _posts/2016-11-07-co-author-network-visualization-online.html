Can you imagine an abstract world, in which, researchers are like the stars in the dark skys. And they are connect with each other by some kind of abstract topics. For example, the researchers who works most on the lstm should be embedded in a near place and the researchers write most paper on optimizations should also be placed in the near place. Further more, the similar topics should also be put in the neighborhood. An interesting truth is that Hinton him self becomes one of the most famous topic, and this topic is surrounded by many topics about the neural network.
