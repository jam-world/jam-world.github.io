<div id="outline-container-orgheadline1" class="outline-2">
<h2 id="orgheadline1">Draw graph with ditaa in org-mode</h2>
<div class="outline-text-2" id="text-orgheadline1">
<p>
I have worried for how to make beautiful graphs in the org-mode for a long time. However, I just find an awesome way to do it. In fact, the only thing I need to do for a beautiful image is just open a new source block with the source code ditaa, like this:

<div class="figure">
<p><img src="/img/hi.png" alt="hi.png" />
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
