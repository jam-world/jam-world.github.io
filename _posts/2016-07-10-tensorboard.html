I have wondered for a long time why should I move on to the tensorflow frameworks. I have learned the torch frameworks and theano. However, I just decided to change my main frameworks to the tensorflow. The main reason here is the tensorboard. CNN is quite confusing these days since a normal CNN these days will contain a huge amount of layers and tons of the computation nodes, which makes it very difficult for the human beings to understand. Especially, when the whole things you have is just the code.
